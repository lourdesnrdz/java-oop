## General info
 On this course I learned to apply Object Oriented Programming in Java. We analized and created a solution to the medical appointments problem, where we applied concepts sush as inheritance and polimorfism. 

 Also, I learned to use abstract classes and methods, annomymous classes, interface and the difference between all these.

 We also made use of collections throughout the course, such as ArrayList, Map and TreeMap.

 One important thing that I take with me from this course is the importance of modularity and how by splitting the program into smaller sections we can create more readable programs. This allows us to detect problems or errors faster, to re-use code and makes mainting the code easier.
